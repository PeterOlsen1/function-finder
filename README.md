# function-finder! ðŸ”ŽðŸ”ŽðŸ”Ž

This repo is my first attempt at rust. ðŸ¦€

In my job over the summer, I find it hard to keep track of where all my functions are called, so I'm taking it upon myself to create some sort of executeable / extension that will find all times a function is called, and display information about them. Not entirely sure yet how this will be executed or how far I will go with it, but the project is still in its infancy.

Ideas:
```
Interfacing
  -Allow users to pass in a function name and filename through CLI interface
    -Use crate::clap for CLI parsing
    -If no arguments are found, list all functions?
    -If the function name is close to one found,
Parsing
  -Use multithreading for faster fileIO
    -Start single threaded, figure out the basics first
  -Parse files until we find 'function ____()'
    -Start with functions defined by 'function'
    -See later about:
      -Commented lines
      -Arrow functions assigned to values
      -Calls contained in strings  
```
